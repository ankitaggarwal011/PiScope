<br>
<br>

An **Oscilloscope** is an instrument that can be used <br>
to display / analyze the waveform of electric signals.

In effect, the device draws a graph of <br>
the signal voltage as a function of time.

A **XY Plotter** is an instrument that plots <br>
two voltage with respect to one another.

<br>

## Motivation

I wanted to monitor analog sensors with my Raspberry Pi <br>
but I didn't have an actual oscilloscope, not to mention <br>
how costly they are as well as the space they take up.

While it isn't very precise, it may come <br>in handy in a multitude of applications.
